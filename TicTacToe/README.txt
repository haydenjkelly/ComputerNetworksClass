The client file starts by having a player insert a unique client id and a name.

The game then finds an opponent and the game is played by players inputting an index for where they want to move.

the indexes are set up like the following diagram:

 0 | 1 | 2
-----------
 3 | 4 | 5
-----------
 6 | 7 | 8 

 when the game ends, the player can get a new opponent or can stop playing.
 
 The server files attached are not updated as the updated version has an Unregister protocol.
